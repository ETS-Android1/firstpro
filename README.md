# Faille Winter
Drowsiness detection application using Android Studio &amp; Google Vision API. The codes are written in Java &amp; XML.
Road accidents do not happen they are caused, and one of them is drivers not paying enough attention. Many a times while driving on highways and freeways the drive makes drivers drowsy. In order to prevent this Faille Winter will detect when the driver is becoming drowsy and rings an alarm to make the driver attentive again. This is a small step we came up with to reduce accidents on road.
